Computers have always been superior in performing complex calculations in milliseconds. 
However, even modern computers feel shy of human brain in two tasks, language and vision. 
Human brain, a mass of billions of interconnected neurons can understand language between the lines and easily see. 
What enables us outperform computers ?
Our ability to learn from mistakes. 
What if computers can be modeled as a network of neurons that can learn from its mistakes.
The bio-inspired architectures of computing models, referred to as neural networks, are based on this very idea of learning from errors.

The Perceptron, one of the very first ideas of modeling neural networks was introduced by Rosanblatt in 1961.
