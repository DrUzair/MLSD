y = 1/1+e^(ax+B) the link function

glm(vs~mpg + wt, data=mtcars)

Deviance: Measure of Badness 0f Fit --> Lower ther better

Null Deviance:  How good/bad are the estimates of response variable using ONLY INTERCEPT or (grand mean)

Residual Deciance: How better/worse are the estimates of response variable using other INDEPENDENT vars in addition to the INTERCEPT or (grand mean)

DoF Null/Residual Deviance

Fisher Scoring Algorithm (maximum likelihood estimation)

AIC: comparing related models ~ related concept ~ Adjusted R-squared
Penalize including inrrelevant variables.


Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit: (another piece of measurement of goodness)
 - Measures difference between the model and the samples

 - library(ResourceSelection)
 - hoslem.test(mtcars$vs, fitted(model))
 - lower p-value(than alpha) indicates significant difference between obs and model output
