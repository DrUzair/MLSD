y = 1/1+e^(ax+B) the link function

glm(vs~mpg + wt, data=mtcars)

Deviance: Measure of Badness 0f Fit --> the lower the better

Null Deviance:  How good/bad are the estimates of response variable using ONLY INTERCEPT or (grand mean)

Residual Deciance: How better/worse are the estimates of response variable using other INDEPENDENT vars in addition to the INTERCEPT or (grand mean)

DoF Null/Residual Deviance

Fisher Scoring Algorithm (maximum likelihood estimation)

AIC: comparing related models ~ related concept ~ Adjusted R-squared
Penalize including inrrelevant variables.

Parsimony
unvderfitting (high bias) vs. overfitting (generalizability)
bias <--> variance of a model
  AIC = 2K - log(Likelihood( params | data) )2 --> [Burnham & Anderson 2002]K: dof (estimable params)
  AICc = AIC + 2K(K+1)/(n-k-1) --> small sample correction [Hurvich&Tsai 1989]
  Akaike (1973) : what and how regressors influence dependent var

The best model has the LOWEST AIC

Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit: (another piece of measurement of goodness)
 - Measures difference between the model and the samples
 - library(ResourceSelection)
 - hoslem.test(mtcars$vs, fitted(model))
 - lower p-value(than alpha) indicates significant difference between obs and model output
