Parsimony

unvderfitting (high bias) vs. overfitting (generalizability)

bias <--> variance of a model

AIC = 2K - log(Likelihood( params | data) )
2 --> [Burnham & Anderson 2002]
K: dof (estimable params)

AICc = AIC + 2K(K+1)/(n-k-1) --> small sample correction [Hurvich&Tsai 1989]

Akaike (1973) : what and how regressors influence dependent var

The best model has the LOWEST AIC
